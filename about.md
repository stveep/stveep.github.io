I work at the [Institute of Cancer Research](http://www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/researchers-and-teams/dr-stephen-pettitt) in London, looking for genetic determinants of sensitivity and resistance to cancer drugs. In particular, I'm interested in drugs affecting DNA repair pathways such as PARP inhibitors. I use CRISPR, transposons, Illumina, Ion Torrent and Nanopore sequencing and any other cool experimental genetic technology that I can get my hands on! I analyse my data using Ruby, R, Python and more.

In my spare time I also contribute to open source software, mainly Ruby/Rails.
