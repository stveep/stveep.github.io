I love the text editor Vim. Back when I started doing some Bioinformatics work I had a feeling that I should be using a better text editor than pico or whatever it was at the time. I'd heard of vim, so I gave it a go. Starting out with vim is a bewildering experience where any stray key press could accidentally destroy all your work. The twenty minutes or so learning how to actually produce text (and undo mistakes!) pays huge dividends however. I'm still learning and still being impressed by how powerful vim is, and how much you can do it in. I wrote my whole thesis in vim in a terminal window.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
